# BST-Implementation
here you will find the implementation of the BST in java with it's functions
Small explanation about trees:
A tree is a non-linear data structure to store data & informatinos.
A tree consists of nodes & links with a restriction(each link point form an uppre node"father node" to a node down(son) meanning you can only go from the father to the son and not the opposite)
Each node has only one father
Each node can has multiple sons

BST(Binary Search Tree):
this is a type of tree that has one extra restriction, the left son is smaller then the node && the right son is bigger ==> the all the nodes in the left subtree are smaller than the father and all the nodes of the right subtree are bigger than the father node
